  <h3 class="sketch">Brief Biographical Sketch</h3>
  <p>
    Dr. Stewart is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department and Faculty-In-Residence in the Translational Data Analytics Institute (TDAI) at The Ohio State University.  He leads the <a href="lab.html">ReRout Lab</a> where high-impact research produces novel systems and diverse expertise that broadens computer science, i.e., research that reaches out.&nbsp;Dr. Stewart's research has led to fundamental intellectual contributions on the design of  cloud computing systems, sustainable computing systems and STEM education. Common themes across his work are rigorous but usable mathematical models and end-to-end validation of the models using prototypes implemented within widely used systems software components.  Dr. Stewart's recent research focuses on 1) supporting interactive Internet services in the era of dark silicon (i.e., post Dennard Scaling) and 2) systems support for autonomous systems and IoT.

  <h3 class="highlights">Highlights</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In April 2018, we presented <a href="../data/morris2018modeldriven.pdf">Model-Driven Computational Sprinting</a> at the European Conference on Computer Systems (EuroSys). Our work addresses a common problem for cloud systems: when should I overclock servers given energy/themal limits? Our approach systematically explores all possible overclocking strategies and finds solutions that outperform state-of-the-art by up to 3.16X. </li>
    <li>I am a PI on the <a href="https://latino-astudies.osu.edu/news/assistant-professor-arnulfo-p%C3%A9rez-wins-1.2-million-nsf-grant">Stem+C project</a>.  In 2017, we deployed a smart <a href="../data/siva2017preliminary.pdf">classroom platform</a> that was used to teach algebra and programming to over 1300 students in the Grove City School District. Siva Renganathan, the lead student, is now at Apple.</li>
    <li>The OSU ACM-W chapter was named an outstanding chapter for 2016. In 2017, we sent a 24 women to the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing.</li>
