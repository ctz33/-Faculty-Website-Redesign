      <h3>Research Challenge:</h3>
      <p>
        Internet services that provide search, e-commerce, and social networking have changed the world, but their growing carbon footprint is a concern.  By 2020, the annual carbon footprint of hosting centers worldwide is expected to exceed the footprint of the Netherlands.  Massive carbon footprints contribute to climate change and could lead to costly, punitive regulations.  Our research attempts to slow the growth of carbon footprints by moving Internet services to clean energy.  The challenge is that, as of today, most sources of clean energy are more expensive per joule than dirty sources.

      </p>
      <p>
        We propose greening services, a new type of service that aligns clean energy goals with profit incentives.  Greening services use clean energy to power requests routed through their servers, even if those requests access servers run by other services.   In other words, a greening service is a service that makes other services green.  In our vision, greening services will use renewable energy credits or carbon offsets.  These transferable certificates undo greenhouse-gas emissions transparently, even when emissions occur in carbon-heavy areas, making them attractive to large-scale, geographically distributed services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Greening services work because some users will prefer to route their requests through environmentally sustainable services.  Greening services can profit from those users without incurring the full costs of running large scale services.  However, greening services must manage their costs.  Our systems research studies the potential for caching on greening services.  We also study the challenge of accurately accounting the carbon footprint of remote servers.

        <a href="https://www.datagreening.com/">Datagreening.com</a> is prototype greening service.  It moves email (specifically, IMAP) to clean energy.  The site is publically accessible in the Beta version.  Our goal is to offset 2 Tonnes of CO2E in 2014.  We support any type of email that can be accessed through IMAP, in particular we often host GMail, Yahoo, Hotmail users.

      <h3>Research Challenge:</h3>
      <p>
        Over 90% of the world's digital data was produced in the last 2 years. The next generation of Internet services will access a lot of data for each user request, but neither processor speeds nor expectations for fast response times change.  We are building cloud infrastructure, e.g., key-value stores and data-parallel platforms, that can efficiently and scalably access large ammounts of data in seconds.  The increasing density of main memory serves as a building block for such services.  However, main memory systems are sensitive to performance anomalies at scale, i.e., 100 to 1000 threads per user request.  In such systems, response times can depend on the slowest main memory acceess times---not the average access times.  Unfortunately, access times in practice are not normally distributed.  The slowest accesses can 100X larger than the average, causing large delays.  It is also challenging to keep main memory systems fully utilized.  Small slowdowns caused by background jobs, compliance software, or garbage collection can ripple throughout the processing pipeline, leading to inefficient execution and slow response times.

      <h3>Impact: </h3>
      <p>Working with researchers at Nationwide Children's Hostpital, we have parallized <a href="http://www.mathmed.org/wclstewart/SOFT/EAGLET/eaglet.html">EAGLET</a>, a popular tool used to study disease causing genes by statistical geneticists. The EAGLET package comprises C, C++, Perl, and Bash code. It was written to maximize single-thread performance and usability. Rather than rewite the whole package, we integrated EAGLET into a data-parallel framework that could handle such legacy code: BashReduce. We have significantly extended BashReduce in this effort. Our parallel version will replace the existing EAGLET distribution on the software's next release. We also plan to release our <a href="http://rcrowley.org/2009/06/27/bashreduce.html">BashReduce</a> improvements as open source.
      </p>
      <p>We also developed Zoolander, a key value store that support strict service level objectives (e.g., 99.99% of gets and puts complete in less than 5ms). Zoolander uses commodity hardware and can extend any open source key value store (e.g., Redis or Zookeeper). We have scaled Zoolander up to 120 nodes on Amazon EC2, achieving requests rates at the scale of TripAdvisor while meeting strict SLOs.</p>
      <h3>Media and Press Release:</h3>
      <p>We expect a production release of EAGLET with our parallel infrastructure soon. Stay tuned. </p>

      <h3>Research Challenge:</h3>
      <p>For many next generation services, data will grow much faster than processing capacity.  These services will access only a portion of the data relevant to a user's query.  Our research helps services automatically 1) identify the most valuable data for each user request and 2) ensure it can be accessed readily and cost effectively.  Thus far, we have focused on natural language processing services, e.g., search engines and question-answering systems.  For a specific user request, NL data often contains redundancies, e.g., multiple web pages with the same information or multiple word phrases with same meaning.  These redundancies can crowd out useful data causing to NLP services to produce poor quality results.  Our contribution is systems support to measure quality for distributed services and, subsequently, manage resources cost effectively within quality constraints.</p>
